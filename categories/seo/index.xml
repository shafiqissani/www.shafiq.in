          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;emember to always use the hyphen character (-) in your weblinks if it contains more than one word. That way, you&#39;ll get more value from your URL keywords. Google treats hyphen (-) like a space, while it treats underscore as a non-breaking space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slash character / is also treated as a space, by the way. I wouldn&#39;t use that in a URL, but you are safe using it to separate two keywords in your texts.&lt;/p&gt;
