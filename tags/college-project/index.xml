          <description>&lt;p&gt;I had mentioned earlier on twitter that I will be uploading some recovered data from my broken hard drive. So here is the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following is the link to a self extracting archive of the first project I ever did. The college website! ...with help of the Subhash Dasyam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shafiqissani/ASTRA-College-Website&#34;&gt;https://github.com/shafiqissani/ASTRA-College-Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very very very old project. The structure of the website and code is horrible and outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you scan this for virus. Most systems in our college were compromised. Also there should be a php shell in there somewhere ... we used it for administrative purposes only.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thank you shout out to Mrs. Aruna Ranganath (CSE Head of Department) for getting me involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahhh... I feel nostalgic.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
