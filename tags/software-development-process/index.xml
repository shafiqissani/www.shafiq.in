          <description>&lt;p&gt;The team&#39;s development process defines who is doing what, when, and how.&lt;br /&gt;
In the waterfall model, software activities proceed through a sequence of steps, with each step based on the activities of the previous step.&lt;br /&gt;
The spiral model begins with a series of risk-driven prototypes, followed by a structured waterfall-like process.&lt;br /&gt;
The iterative approach, a hybrid of the waterfall and spiral models, decouples the lifecycle phases from the software activities that take place in each phase.&lt;br /&gt;
No matter what model you use, you must develop at least one early prototype to get customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;One of the most frustrating, pervasive, and seemingly downright sinister problems in all of application development is the &#34;Yes, But&#34; syndrome, being the observation of the users&#39; reaction to every piece of software I have ever developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;For whatever reason, I always observe two immediate, distinct, and separate reactions when the users see the system implementation for the first time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;• &#34;Wow, this is so cool; we can really use this, what a neat job,&lt;br /&gt;
atta boy,&#34; and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
• &#34;Yes, but, hmmmmm, now that I see it, what about this ... ?&lt;br /&gt;
Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if ... ? Whatever happened to ... ?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;The roots of the &#34;Yes, But&#34; syndrome appear to lie deep in the nature of software as an intangible intellectual process.&lt;/p&gt;
