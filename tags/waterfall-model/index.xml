          <description>&lt;p&gt;The team&#39;s development process defines who is doing what, when, and how.&lt;br /&gt;
In the waterfall model, software activities proceed through a sequence of steps, with each step based on the activities of the previous step.&lt;br /&gt;
The spiral model begins with a series of risk-driven prototypes, followed by a structured waterfall-like process.&lt;br /&gt;
The iterative approach, a hybrid of the waterfall and spiral models, decouples the lifecycle phases from the software activities that take place in each phase.&lt;br /&gt;
No matter what model you use, you must develop at least one early prototype to get customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
